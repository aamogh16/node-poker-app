This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, define the backend host and port to point to in your `.env` file:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=<host>`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_PORT=<port>`

Then, run the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

If your backend is running and is connected, an empty board should pop up promptly.
