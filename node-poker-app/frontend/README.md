This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, define the backend host and port to point to in your `.env` file:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=<host>`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_PORT=<port>`
- `SOCKET_KEY=<admin-socket-key>` // Required for admin actions like deal and restart

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

If your backend is running and is connected, an empty board should pop up promptly.
